Hangman needs a minimum of two players (unless youâ€™re playing against a computer), one sets the phrase/word, and one guesses the answer. It can be played between teams or with one group member posing the question to the others. 
First of all, you will need something like paper and a pencil to play. The objective of Hangman is to guess the word, letter by letter, posed by the questioner before the complete picture of the hanging man is drawn.

The rules of Hangman are simple. If more than one person is guessing the letters, each one must take a turn to call out the chosen letter. This is a good exercise for teaching children to have patience.  
Words, as well as phrases, can be used. Usually, proper nouns such as personal names, places, or brands may not be used. The team or person that answers correctly continues with another chance until an error is made.
